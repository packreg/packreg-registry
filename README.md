[![bitHound Overall Score](https://www.bithound.io/github/packreg/packreg-registry/badges/score.svg)](https://www.bithound.io/github/packreg/packreg-registry)   

Packreg is a package-registry that combines packages of different package-managers like Bower and npm with statistics and an "immutable" API, which clients can easily interact with. It is built on RethinkDB and elasticsearch which are accessed through Netflix' Falcor and populated by different collectors and analyzers that provide the actual metadata.
